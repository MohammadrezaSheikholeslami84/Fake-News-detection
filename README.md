# Fake News Detection

## Description
The **Fake News Detection** project is designed to help identify and classify fake news articles from legitimate ones. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the system analyzes the content of news articles and predicts whether they are real or fake.

The project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in detecting fake news. It also integrates various data processing methods to clean and prepare the data for model training, making it a comprehensive solution for detecting misinformation in media.

Key features include:
- **Text Classification**: Uses machine learning models to classify news articles as fake or real.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements various text cleaning techniques, such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Model Evaluation**: Utilizes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the performance of the classification models using graphs and charts.

## Model Accuracy
The model achieves an accuracy of **[98]%** in classifying fake news articles. The performance was evaluated using standard metrics, and the model demonstrates a high level of reliability in distinguishing between fake and real news.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
